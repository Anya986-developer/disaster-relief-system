# Disaster Relief Stablecoin System

A blockchain-based prototype designed to improve transparency, speed, and accountability in disaster relief fund distribution using stablecoins.

## Problem
Disaster relief funds often face delays, leakage, and lack of transparency. Donors and authorities have limited visibility into how funds are distributed, and beneficiaries may not receive timely or appropriate aid.

## Solution Overview
This project proposes a stablecoin-powered relief distribution system where funds are transferred directly to verified beneficiaries. Blockchain ensures an immutable audit trail, while smart contracts enable basic spending controls and transparency.

## Key Features
- Role-based dashboards (Admin / Authority / Beneficiary)
- Beneficiary whitelisting
- Stablecoin-based fund transfer simulation
- Publicly auditable transaction flow
- Deployed frontend prototype

## Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture:
- Frontend for role-based interaction
- Application layer for business logic
- Smart contracts for fund flow rules and transparency
- Blockchain layer for immutable record keeping

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React, if applicable)
- Blockchain: Ethereum-compatible network
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Wallet Integration: (e.g., MetaMask / simulated wallets)
- Deployment: GitHub Pages 

## Demo
- Live deployed frontend: [https://youtu.be/WIjf1qgk80g?si=tjvRgbrQ10B_jLEu]
- Demo video: Submitted as part of the hackathon
- PPT: Submitted as part of the hackathon

## Hackathon Scope & Limitations
This is a hackathon prototype intended to demonstrate the core concept of transparent relief fund distribution. Advanced enforcement mechanisms, real-world identity verification, and full backend integrations are considered future work.

## Future Enhancements
- Category-based spending enforcement at smart contract level
- Integration with verified identity providers
- Real-time analytics for donors and authorities
- Multi-chain or CBDC support
